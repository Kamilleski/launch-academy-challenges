THE IDEA TO END ALL IDEAS

*Campus Verus*
Making the world a better place by de-bullshitting the college tour process. _Real_ college students are paired with _real_ high school students for _real_ perspectives that would not necessarily be revealed in a university-sanctioned tour. College is one of the biggest investments an individual will ever make, and to go into it full of misinformation is a disservice to everyone involved and society at large.

*Model Interaction*
There are separate logins for tourists and tour guides. Tour guides are verified with a .edu email address. Tourists can view all guides' first names/pictures/majors for on each university page. Clicking on a tour guide will show more information about that person and include a contact link that will begin the coordination process between tourist and tour guide. After a tour is conducted tourists will be able to leave reviews on their tour guide's page, which will later be viewable on that guide's details page. Tours will be unique in that a certain percentage of the time must also be spent OFF CAMPUS and that guides will be no-holds-barred on true/relevant information for tourists.

*Fancy Features*
 - Campus maps from Google maps?
 - Google Trends news about college
 - Crime stats and map?

*Nice to Have*
Once I get millions of dollars in seed funding, tour guides will be able to enter a "touring" mode on their phone app, which will record their commentary with an external microphone while tracking their gps movements so that by the end there is a followable path that future tourists can take and then review.
